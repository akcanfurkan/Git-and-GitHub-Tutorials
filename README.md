## Advices
---

> First of all, the links I share, articles, books, etc. are the resources I work with.
In summary, the recommendations I can give are as follows:
>
- The first thing you need to do is understand the logic of Git. If you understand why commands such as commit, add are done, it will be easier for you to learn. 

![For example](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*InGbmTApX_UOIA9x.png)

- In particular, learning the concepts such as "working directory, staging area, local repo, remote repo" at first will contribute a lot to your better understanding of the process.

![For example](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--M_fHUEqA--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/128hsgntnsu9bww0y8sz.png)

![For example](https://serkankaya.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/gitworkflow.png)

- You have to get used to using terminal. You need to master the "Git Bash" terminal.

- Getting used to these commands will make your work easier:

```
pwd
clear
cd
ls
ls -al
cd
cd ..
rm
touch
mkdir

```
- You should pay attention to issues such as using Markdown, ".gitignore", how to commit well, branches.

- While learning from the sources I shared above, it will be beneficial for your learning process if you create a sample project from the terminal or VsCode and try the commands. (This was the situation that developed me the most and enabled me to learn.)

- "How to contribute to open source code?" Another important step that you need to learn and practice.

- You need to know what to do in case of two branch conflicts. (There are people who describe this situation in the sources I gave above) Therefore, You should know these commands:

```
git push
git pull
git clone
git fetch
git merge
git checkout
git revert
git restore

```
